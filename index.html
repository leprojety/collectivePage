            <h2>Collective Representation and Shared Agentivity in Artificial Architectures</h2>
            <p>In psychology, it has been proposed that certain shared and collective​
                representations possess their own existence beyond individual​
                representations. This can occur through a communal space of concepts, memories, or language. For example, Carl Jung argued that psychic activity transcends the brain to explain phenomena such as​
                synchronicity and extra-sensory perception. He theorized a collective​
                unconscious to explain some observed phenomena. In his theory, the​
                collective unconscious refers to the part of the global unconscious​
                mind shared by all human beings, containing universal experiences,​
                memories, and symbols inherited from our ancestral or evolutionary​
                past. This suggests the existence of a shared field of knowledge that​
                we cannot fully access through our sensory and conscious experience.​
                ​
                Our focus is on how artificial architectures underlying artificial​
                agents can share their representations to build a common sense and​
                collective construct. We will propose a model of agentivity for the​
                assembly of agents that accounts for the agentivity of the parts but​
                cannot be restricted to them.
